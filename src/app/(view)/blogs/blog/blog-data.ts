  `<h1 class="blogTitle">A Day in Milly's Shoes: Life with Type 1 Diabetes</h1>
  <p class="blogPara">Good morning, sunshine! The alarm clock rings, and Milly stretches her arms wide. It's time for another fun-filled day! But before she can run off to play with Rio, there's something important she has to do—check her blood sugar! "Let's see where we're at, Rio!" Milly says as she pricks her finger. Beep! Her blood glucose meter gives her a number.</p>
  
  <h1 class="blogTitle">🩸 What's Blood Sugar?</h1>
  <p class="blogPara">Blood sugar is the amount of sugar (glucose) in our blood, and for kids like Milly, who have Type 1 Diabetes, keeping it in balance is super important! Too high? She might feel tired. Too low? She might feel dizzy. But don't worry—Milly's got this!</p>
  
  <h1 class="blogTitle">🥣 Breakfast Time 🍳</h1>
  <p class="blogPara">After checking her blood sugar, Milly grabs her plate: scrambled eggs, strawberries, and a yummy slice of avocado toast. She counts her carbs to know exactly how much insulin she needs.</p>
  
  <h1 class="blogTitle">💉 Did you know?</h1>
  <p class="blogPara">Insulin is like a key—it helps unlock the energy from food so Milly can run, jump, and play all day! Since Milly's pancreas doesn't make insulin, she gets it through her insulin pump or an injection. Rio wags his tail, watching as Milly presses a few buttons on her insulin pump. "All set, Rio!"</p>
  
  <h1 class="blogTitle">🌳 Playground Fun & a Little Check-In 📱</h1>
  <p class="blogPara">At recess, Milly races to the swings. Up, up, up she goes! But after a while, she feels a little... funny. Her continuous glucose monitor (CGM) beeps, alerting her that her blood sugar is dropping. Rio's ears perk up—he can sense it too! "Good boy, Rio!" Milly says as she reaches for her juice box. A few sips later, her energy comes back.</p>
  
  <h1 class="blogTitle">💡 Did you know?</h1>
  <p class="blogPara">Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) can happen when kids with Type 1 Diabetes play really hard. That's why Milly always carries a juice box, glucose tablets, or a small snack to keep her feeling great!</p>
  
  <h1 class="blogTitle">🥪 Lunchtime & Learning 🍎</h1>
  <p class="blogPara">Back in class, Milly takes out her lunch. She's got a grilled cheese sandwich with apple slices and a small cup of yogurt. Before eating, she counts her carbs again and gives herself insulin. Her best friend, Bella, helps her out. "Milly, I saved a seat for you!" she says.</p>
  
  <h1 class="blogTitle">🫂 Friends can help!</h1>

  <h1 class="blogTitle">🏡 Home Sweet Home 🌙</h1>
  <p class="blogPara">After school, Milly and Rio relax with a fun game of hide-and-seek. Before bedtime, she checks her blood sugar one last time. All good! Milly snuggles into bed, Rio curled up next to her. "Goodnight, Rio," she whispers. "Tomorrow's another adventure."</p>
